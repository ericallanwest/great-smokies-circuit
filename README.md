# Routing / Optimization
This is the area of greatest interest to those attempting an efficient map completion. The [Traveling Salesman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) is perhaps the most studied routing optimization problem, but the goal of the TSP is to visit points (nodes), not lines (edges/arcs). Hiking all the trails in the park is an [arc routing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_routing) problem that most closely resembles the [Chinese Postman Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_postman_problem).

The impact of elevation change makes the trail network "windy", as it takes more time/energy to travel uphill. For a self-supported journey, the trail network is also "rural" in that roads or non-required trails can be used to more efficiently complete the map. The [Windy Rural Postman Problem (WRPP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_routing#Windy_postman_problem_and_variants) is reasonably well known in the literature and algorithms have been created to calculate optimal (or near-optimal) solutions.
 
- [Postman Problems](https://github.com/brooksandrew/postman_problems) - Python code for solving the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP) and the Rural Postman Problem (RPP). I used this to plan my Great Smokies Circuit hike.
- [ArcRoutingLibrary](https://github.com/Olibear/ArcRoutingLibrary) - Java code with solvers for many Postman Problem variants. The code is nearly 10 years old and I have not figured out how to run it on WRPP problems.
- [The Chinese-Postman-Method](https://web.archive.org/web/20210514003240/https://www-m9.ma.tum.de/graph-algorithms/directed-chinese-postman/index_en.html) - Interactive tutorial that illustrates the algorithm for solving Postman problems.
